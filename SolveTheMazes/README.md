Here are three mazes. You have to write the code to get a ball sprite from the arrow through the mazes to the yellow square. 

### Maze no 1:

### Maze no 2:

### Maze no 3:

The challenge is that you have to use the **_SAME CODE_** for **_ALL THREE MAZES!!!_**

Hint: **if** blocks might be useful.


Here is a Scratch project which has the three mazes and the ball sprite ready set up. You can remix this project with your own Scratch user ID to solve the challenge:

As you can see from this image it is possible to solve all three mazes with quite a short programme:
